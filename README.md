# Welcome to GWSurrogate! #

GWSurrogate is an easy to use interface to gravitational wave surrogate models.

Surrogates provide a fast and accurate evaluation mechanism for gravitational
waveforms which would otherwise be found through solving differential
equations. These equations must be solved in the ``building" phase, which
was performed using other codes. For details see

models". Phys. Rev. X 4, 031006 (2014). arXiv: gr-qc:1308.3565

If you find this package useful in your work, please cite reference [1] and,
if available, the relevant paper describing the specific surrogate used.

All available models can be found in gwsurrogate.catalog.list()

gwsurrogate is available at https://pypi.python.org

# Installation #

## Dependency ##

gwsurrogate requires:

1)  gwtools. If you are installing gwsurrogate with pip you
will automatically get gwtools. If you are installing gwsurrogate from
source, please see https://bitbucket.org/chadgalley/gwtools/

2) gsl. For speed, the long (hybrid) surrogates use gsl's spline function.
To build gwsurrogate you must have gsl installed. Fortunately, this is a
common library and can be easily installed with a package manager.

Note that at runtime (ie when you do import gwsurrogate) you may need to let
gsl know where your BLAS library is installed. This can be done by setting
your LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables. A relevant example:

```
>>> export LD_PRELOAD=~/anaconda3/envs/python27/lib/libgslcblas.so
```

## From pip ##

The python package pip supports installing from PyPI (the Python Package
Index). gwsurrogate can be installed to the standard location
(e.g. /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/dist-packages) with

```
>>> pip install gwsurrogate
```

If there is no binary/wheel package already available for your operating system, the installer will
try to build the package from the sources. For that, you would need to have `gsl` installed already.
The installer will look for `GSL` inside `/opt/local/`. You may provide additional paths with the
`CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables. 

In the case of an `homebrew` installation, you may install the package like this:

```
>>> export HOMEBREW_HOME=`brew --prefix`
>>> 
>>> export CPPFLAGS="-I$HOMEBREW_HOME/include/"
>>> export LDFLAGS="-L$HOMEBREW_HOME/lib/"
>>> pip install gwsurrogate
```



## From conda ##

`gwsurrogate` is [on conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gwsurrogate), and can be installed with

```
>>> conda install -c conda-forge gwsurrogate
```

Note: As of Feb 9th 2024, installation with Python 3.12 with conda doesn't work. Please use either use Python <= 3.11 or pip instead.

## From source (pip) ##

First, please ensure you have the necessary dependencies
installed (see above). Next, git clone this project, to any
folder of your choosing. Then run

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

For a "proper" installation, run the following commands from the top-level gwsurrogate folder containing setup.py

```
>>> python -m pip install .            # option 1
>>> python -m pip install --editable . # option 2
```

where the "--editable" installs an editable (development) project with pip. This allows
your local code edits to be automatically seen by the system-wide installation.

# Usage #

## Available models
To get a list of all available surrogate models, do:
```python

```

### Current NR models
The most up-to-date models trained on numerical relativity data are listed below, along with links to example
notebooks.
- [NRSur7dq4](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/gwsurrogate/blob/master/tutorial/website/NRSur7dq4.ipynb):
  For generically precessing BBHs, trained on mass ratios q≤4. Paper:
  [arxiv:1905.09300](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09300).
- [NRHybSur3dq8](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/gwsurrogate/blob/master/tutorial/website/NRHybSur3dq8.ipynb):
  For nonprecessing BBHs, trained on mass ratios q≤8. Paper:
  [arxiv:1812.07865](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07865).
- [NRHybSur2dq15](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/gwsurrogate/blob/master/tutorial/website/NRHybSur2dq15.ipynb):

  [arxiv:2204.01972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01972).

## Download surrogate data and load it
Pick a model, let's say `NRSur7dq4` and download the data. Note this only
needs to be done once.
```python
gwsurrogate.catalog.pull('NRSur7dq4')       # This can take a few minutes
```

Load the surrogate, this only needs to be done once at the start of a script
```python
sur = gwsurrogate.LoadSurrogate('NRSur7dq4')
```

## Evaluate the surrogate
```python
q = 4                           # mass ratio, mA/mB >= 1.
chiA = [-0.2, 0.4, 0.1]         # Dimensionless spin of heavier BH
chiB = [-0.5, 0.2, -0.4]        # Dimensionless of lighter BH
dt = 0.1                        # timestep size, Units of total mass M
f_low = 0                       # initial frequency, f_low=0 returns the full surrogate

# optional parameters for a precessing surrogate models
precessing_opts = {'return_dynamics': True}

# h is dictionary of spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes
# t is the corresponding time array in units of M
# dyn stands for dynamics, do dyn.keys() to see contents
t, h, dyn = sur(q, chiA, chiB, dt=dt, f_low=f_low, precessing_opts=precessing_opts)
```

There are many more options, such as using MKS units, returning the
polarizations instead of the modes, etc.  Read the documentation for more
details.
```python
help(sur)
```

Jupyter notebooks located in
[tutorial/website](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/gwsurrogate/blob/master/tutorial/website)
give a more comprehensive overview of individual models.


# Tests #

If you have git cloned this project and installed (and intalled it
using the `--editable` option), its a good idea to run some regression tests. 


```
>>> cd test                              # move into the folder test
>>> python download_regression_models.py # download all surrogate models to test
>>> python test_model_regression.py      # (optional - if developing a new test) generate regression data locally on your machine
>>> cd ..                                # move back to the top-level folder
>>> pytest                               # run all tests
>>> pytest -v -s                         # run all tests with high verbosity
```
