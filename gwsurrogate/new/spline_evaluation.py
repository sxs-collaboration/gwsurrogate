Tensor spline evaluation code.
The intended use case is when we have very many different splines which
all have the same domain (breakpoints). Careful usage of numpy keeps the
added computational cost of using python vs. (for example) C with gsl
minimal when evaluating all splines simultaneously at the same parameter
value.
